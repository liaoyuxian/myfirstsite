    <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way: 
        <ul>
            <li>Walla Walla, WA, </li>
            <li>Magic City, ID, </li>
            <li>Bountiful, UT, </li>
            <li>Last Chance, CO, </li>
            <li>Why, AZ and </li>
            <li>Truth or Consequences, NM.</li>
        </ul></p>
    
    <h2><p>July 14, 2012</p></h2>
    <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: 

   <blockquote>Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity.</blockquote>

    <p>I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>
    
    <h2><p>June 2, 2012</p></h2>

    <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: 

        <ol>
   <li>cell phone,</li>
   <li><em>iPod,</em></li>
   <li>digital camera,</li>
   <li>a protein bar</li>
        </ol>     Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said,  </p>
